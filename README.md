# TwitterAnimation

Recreates the Twitter animation that plays when their iOS app initially launches.

Uses CALayer and CAKeyframeAnimation. Built for Xcode 8, but can easily be translated down to work with Xcode 7.

Feel free to replicate and use any code as you please.

Heavily influenced by [Rounak Jain's post on iOS Dev Tips](http://iosdevtips.co/post/88481653818/twitter-ios-app-bird-zoom-animation)
